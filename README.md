css2less
========

This library has created by Remo Laubacher : remo.laubacher@ortic.com
https://github.com/ortic/css2less
This repository is just a re-upload of the package to put it on composer

this library aims to convert CSS files into LESS files.

Currently used by http://www.css2less.net/

example
=======

The code below takes a few CSS instructions and prints them in a more LESS like form:

```php
$cssContent = 'body p { font-family: arial; }';
$css2lessParser = new \Ortic\Css2Less\Css2Less($cssContent);
echo $css2lessParser->getLess();
```

output:

```
body {
        p {
                font-family: arial;
        }
}
```
